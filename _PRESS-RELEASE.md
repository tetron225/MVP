For the XIV Community
People who don't have time to go ingame online

Summary
The purpose of this product is a quality of life for players who are offline. Since xiv players need to check what collectables they still need in the game but they aren't home at their computers/PS4/etc. to see what they will do later because of work, appointments, etc. This is an easy way to manage and plan what they are going to collect in the future.


Problem
Main problem is not everyone can be online for 8-9 hours. Almost everyone has a job to go to, caring for kids, appointments, etc. People don't have time to spend ingame.

Solution
How this program is solved is it is a convenient way for busy people to access their characters and plan ahead before they get home on what they are going to do ingame productively.
